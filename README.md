# Spartans_AI Classifican Model for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It can lead to vision loss if not detected early.
This is an AI model that classifies retinal images into different DR severity levels.
Using a dataset of fundus images, we built a solution that accurately identifies whether an image indicates DR and, if so, informs of its severity level.
