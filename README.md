# Spartans_AI Classifican Model for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
 This is an AI model that classifies retinal images into different DR severity levels. Given a dataset of fundus images, contestants must build a solution that accurately identifies whether an image indicates DR and, if so, its severity level. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It can lead to vision loss if not detected early.
